There are primarily two types of cells: code cells and markdown cells.\nCode Cells: These are cells where you can write and execute code. They are denoted by a [ ]: on the left side of the cell. You can write code in these cells using the programming language supported by the kernel you have chosen (such as Python, R, Julia, etc.). When you run a code cell, the code inside it is executed, and any output generated by the code (such as printed messages, plots, etc.) is displayed below the cell.\nMarkdown Cells: These are cells where you can write formatted text using Markdown syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text without using HTML or other complex markup languages. Markdown cells are denoted by a pencil icon [ ]: on the left side of the cell. You can use Markdown syntax to format text, create headers, lists, links, images, and more. When you run a Markdown cell, it renders the Markdown syntax into formatted text.",
